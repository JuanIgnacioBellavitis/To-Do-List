# To-Do-List

For this project I used Visual Studio 2022,  using C#, ASP.Net Core Web App 6.0, MVC,  Entity Framework, with SQL MANAGMENT STUDIO 18. For the project I also used some Nuget packages, Microsoft.AspNetCore.SqlServer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Design, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Tools and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Session.

It has 2 Views, Folder and Task. The first view it is a list of the folders that you create. Each folder has also their own To-do list. 

The Views have a Create, Delete and Edit button.
